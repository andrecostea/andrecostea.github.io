<p>Were you ever curios why certain languages are designed the way they are? Do you want to bridge the gap between cutting-edge programming languages research and industry needs?</p>

<p>If you’re excited about tackling both deep research challenges and real-world software problems, this project is for you.</p>
<br>
<h2>Job Description</h2>

<p>Seeking a PhD student who values the strengths of formal reasoning while recognizing its current limitations—driven to explore solutions that go beyond what verification alone can achieve. </p>
<p>This PhD project focuses on developing analysis and program repair techniques that enhance interoperability. For example, how can we restore Rust’s safety guarantees when integrating it with legacy C code? More generally, how can we ensure that software components—written in different languages and by different authors, such as human developers and AI assistants—interact correctly, safely, and securely?</p>
<p>The project aims to create synergy between verification, analysis, and testing (primarily Property-Based Testing) to repair faulty software and, in turn, enhance software trustworthiness.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Job Requirements</h2>

<p> Master’s degree in computer science. </p>
<p> Knowledge and interest in programming languages and formal methods. </p>
<p> Strong software engineering skills. </p>
<p> Curiosity and agility to understand and navigate new technologies when applicable.</p>
<p> Effective at managing time and resources. </p>
<p> Has an inclusive mindset and values good communication.</p>

<h2>About the Environment</h2>

We want to create things-–and grow in ways-–that stay solid even when everything else is shifting. We value collaboration, and we also respect the need for focused, independent work. Academia gives us space to explore, but we also like teaming up with industry for fresh ideas and real-world impact. We encourage curiosity and initiative, and always prioritize kind, clear communication for we believe novelty springs from connection and an open mind.
