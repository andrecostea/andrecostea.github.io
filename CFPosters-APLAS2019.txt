The 17th Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems (APLAS) 
aims to stimulate programming language research by providing a forum 
for the presentation of latest results and the exchange of ideas in 
programming languages and systems. APLAS is based in Asia but is an 
international forum that serves the worldwide programming languages 
community. APLAS 2019 will be held in Bali, Indonesia on the 1st â€“ 
4th December 2019.

See: https://conf.researchr.org/track/aplas-2019/aplas-2019-posters

APLAS 2019 includes a poster session during the conference. The poster 
session aims to give students, researchers and professionals an 
opportunity to present technical materials to the research community, 
and to get responses from other researchers in the field.

Poster contributions are sought in all areas of programming languages 
and systems, including the following topics:

     Semantics, logics, foundational theory
     Design of languages, type systems, and foundational calculi
     Domain-specific languages
     Compilers, interpreters, abstract machines
     Program derivation, synthesis, and transformation
     Program analysis, verification, model-checking
     Logic, constraint, probabilistic, and quantum programming
     Software security
     Concurrency and parallelism
     Tools and environments for programming and implementation

Submission
----------
Each presenter should submit an extended abstract of no longer than two 
8.5 x 11 inch pages in PDF by 20 September.  The submission should include 
the title and the complete list of author(s) and affiliation(s). Your 
abstract should contain a brief description of your problem, the key 
contributions of your work, how your work compares to prior research, 
as well as any results from evaluation.  

You can use ths ACM template to format your submission:
        https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template.

We hope to accommodate every presentation, but may restrict them (based 
on relevance and interest to the community) due to space constraints.

Student Research Competition (SRC)
======================================================================
See: https://conf.researchr.org/track/aplas-2019/aplas-2019-posters#Student-Research-Competition

By default, every accepted poster of APLAS 2019 will participate in a 
Student Research Competition (SRC) unless the authors explicitly express 
their wish not do so. To unsubscribe from SRC kindly email the poster 
chair with the subject "Unsubscribe from APLAS19 SRC", providing details 
such as author names and the poster submission number. The competition 
consists of the following phases:

1. Extended abstract: to participate in the SRC, one needs to have 
submitted an extended abstract via the APLAS 2019 posters track and 
to have been accepted for the poster session.

2. Poster Session (during the conference): During the poster session 
of APLAS 2019, a panel formed of poster committee members will discuss 
with each poster presenter to asses their work and to provide feedback 
with respect to their research direction. This committee also chooses 
at least three posters to advance to phase 3.

3. Short Talk (during the conference): the authors reaching this phase 
will have the opportunity to present their work during the APLAS 2019 
Research Papers track during one of the sessions.

Note: This Student Research Competition is NOT a part of ACM SRC;
